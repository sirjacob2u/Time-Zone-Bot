## Roles 

Inorder for the bot to know what user is in which time zone, roles are used to identify users. The current Time-Zones that are supported are AST in the east all the way to PST on the west coast. The roles will need to follow the `VALID_ROLES` listed in line 86

```python
VALID_ROLES = {"atlantic", "east coast", "central", "mountain time", "west coast"}
```

---
## Daylight savings time

The bot has the ability to toggle daylight savings time. Since some regions don't observe daylight savings time this seemed like the easiest way to implemnt this. To enable and disable daylight savings time just type 

```
$daylight yes 
```

and to disable daylight savings time type 

```
$daylight no
```

---
## Birthday message 

The bot can also send a message for a specified users birthday to a specified user. The data for the birthdays are stored in the code where  `dt.date(year,month,day)` 

```python
# List of birthdays
BIRTHDAY_LIST = {
'null': dt.date(2003, 1, 1),
'null': dt.date(2003, 1, 1),
'null': dt.date(2002, 1, 1),
'null': dt.date(2000, 1, 1),
'null': dt.date(2000, 1, 1),
```

To set the channel the bot sends the mesage in. Set the number located at line 18 to the channel ID of the discord channel. 

```python
message_channel_id=555555555555555555
```
